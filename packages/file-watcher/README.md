# File Watcher

A minimal, type-safe file watcher for JavaScript/TypeScript. You can use it to watch a directory for changes and perform actions when changes are detected.

Currently, the package is a thin wrapper around the `chokidar` package. But there are some issues with the `chokidar` package (see the demos in the `playground` folder). We might move to a different package (e.g., [Parcel's Watcher](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher)) in the future.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to this package's docs ([source](../../docs/index.md) or [website](https://proj-coursebook.github.io/file-watcher/)) for how to use it.

## Release & Publish Workflow

### Automated Versioning and Changelog

This package uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to automate versioning and changelog updates. To create a new release:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed.

2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

   This will:

   - Bump the version in `package.json` according to your commit messages (using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.
   - Create a new Git tag for the release.

3. Push your changes and tags:

   ```bash
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

### Publishing to NPM via GitHub Actions

This repository is set up to publish the package to NPM automatically using GitHub Actions:

- **When does it publish?**
  - When you create a new GitHub Release (from the GitHub UI or by pushing a tag and creating a release), or
  - When you manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.

- **What does it do?**
  - Installs dependencies, runs all validation (type-check, lint, format, tests), builds the package, and publishes to NPM if all checks pass.

> [!NOTE]
> You must add your NPM token as a secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository settings for publishing to work.
